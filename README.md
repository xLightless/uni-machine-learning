# uni-machine-learning
A group project by Students in Machine Learning tasked with solving real world problems.

# Installation
- Open VSCode terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/xLightless/uni-machine-learning.git"
- After type "py -m venv .venv"
- Next, change directory (cd) to .venv and then activate it.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Go to the main.ipynb and run the install requirements cell.

# Data Collection
Data can publically be acquired via Yahoo Finance. This project uses an unofficial API to accommodate for the collection of such data.
It also comes with a large community therefore it is a good choice for potential Machine Learning configurations such as SVMs with PSO.

# Machine Learning (UFCFAS-15-2) Individual Assessment, 19th Feb 2024 - 29th March 2024.
Reason: Using ML algorithm classification on real world data.

Learning Outcome:
- MO1 Compare and contrast the basic principles and characteristics# Learning Outcomes

# Individual Assessment
In this individual assignment (Assessment Task A), you are given a 
dataset, and you are required to select, train, apply, evaluate, present 
and compare two different machine learning models using two of the 
contemporary machine learning algorithms the module covers, i.e., SVM 
and ensembles, on the dataset.

## The Dataset:
The dataset is given in a .csv file that is ready to use for 
the assignment. The dataset and its brief description are in the 
Assessment folder on the Blackboard

## The Requirements:
Select, train, apply, evaluate using appropriate performance metrics and 
present an SVM model using an appropriate kernel. Describe, explain and 
justify the selection of any appropriate hyper-parameters (i.e., ùë™, ùíÖ, ùíì, ùú∏) 
for the model. 
Select, train, apply, evaluate using appropriate performance metrics and 
present an ensemble using an appropriate ensemble method. Describe, 
explain and justify the selection of any appropriate hyper-parameters 
(i.e., number of base classifiers, the size of the random subsets of data, 
the size of the random subsets of features, the level of the decision trees, 
learning rate, etc.) for the model.

Describe, explain and justify your approach to building each of the two 
models, including the key machine learning concepts involved, use of any 
library/function that is not covered in any practical notebook, the methods 
you have used and the design decisions you have made in each step. 
Compare the performance of the two models using appropriate 
performance metrics, and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of 
the two models/machine learning algorithms. 
Along with the code cells, you should use the appropriate markdown cells 
in the notebook to structure your notebook, and to describe, explain, 
justify and discuss your work.

## Feedback:
Summative feedback will be provided by the marking grid and 
comments in the completed individual assignment assessment form as 
specified in the marking criteria. The assessment form is expected to be 
released within 2-3 weeks of the submission deadline (excluding 2 weeks 
Easter vocation). 

## Submission:
Your submission consists of a Jupyter Notebook and a converted PDF file 
of the Jupyter Notebook. Please make sure that the submitted notebook 
runs successfully and all the cell outputs are cleared. Please also make 
sure that the submitted PDF file has the cell outputs visible. Please 
name your files as follows: studentNumber.ipynb and studentNumber.pdf.
